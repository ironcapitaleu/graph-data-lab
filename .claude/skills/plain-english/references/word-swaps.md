# Word Swaps

Lookup table for the `plain-english` skill. Read it when you rewrite existing text.

If a word carries no fact, delete it instead of replacing it.

These swaps are our own. They are not the ASD-STE100 approved word list, which stays out of this
repository. See "Dictionary Copyright" in `../SKILL.md`.

## Terms This Project Has Already Fixed

For domain terms and naming conventions, follow the authoritative documents. Do not copy their
words here, because a copy goes stale when the source changes:

- `model/MODEL.md` — the node, edge, and property names of the graph model, such as `Company`,
  `Identifier`, `claim`, and `as_of`.
- `AGENTS.md` — the commit types and the lab workflow.

For terms these documents have not fixed yet, pick one word per concept, then use it in the whole
document. Common pairs that need a choice: config or settings, run or execute, check or validate,
delete or remove, show or display. If a pick must hold across the lab, record it in `MODEL.md` for
domain terms or `AGENTS.md` for workflow terms, so it becomes the source of truth.
